# Project Review: Zulip (Organized chat for distributed teams)

## Getting Started

### Documents

- **[Getting Started, learning how to use Git (the Zulip way))](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)** — Zulip uses GitHub for source control and code review, and becoming familiar with Git is essential for navigating and contributing to the Zulip codebase. They have a very **specific way** they use Git, even for experienced Git users they are still recommended to check out the Git onboarding document (**the zulip way.**) Tey have a page dedicated to introdicng you to zulip's Git-specific tools **(https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/zulip-tools.html)**

- **[README.md](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/main/README.md)** — The repository root README gives a high-level project overview. The page contains links to the social media pages, community chat for any assistance, and points to the developer wiki. Assessment: **Clear** — good entry point to learn more about this project and how to start the onboarding process.

- **[Contribute Page](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/contributing.html)** — This page has clear instructions on how to use their documentation to aid you in contributing to the project with the following statement highlighted, **"Reading and following our written guidelines to the very best of your ability is the only way to become a successful Zulip contributor.)**  There are clear guidelines to their policies, what they permit and what is frowned upon.

- **[GitHub Discussions](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/channel/1-announce/topic/docker/with/2379081)** — This is a project with active members, who are currently in th process of releasing a new version of their product to the general public. The chat is filled with question and answers, notices and updates.

### Code of Conduct
On the how to contribute page, when you click on the get started link, there are a set of rules and regulations to guide you through contributing to this open source project. They have their AI policy which is what stood out to me, it seems they do not discourage the use of AI as long as you can explain your code when asked why X=3.

### User Installation

- **[Zulip.com](https://zulip.com/help/desktop-app-install-guide)** — The product has a download page on their website which leads you to a page where you can download the installation package. On the same page there is an installation guide to guide you on how to install and run their package. The installation guide caters for the three diffeerent operating systems, MacOS, Linux and Windows.

Assessment: **Reasonable** The installation guide is easy to follow as you install the packages making it easy to use.

### Developer Installation

- **[Development Environment](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/index.html)**

Installing the Zulip development environment requires downloading several hundred megabytes of dependencies, so you will need an active, reasonably fast, internet connection throughout the entire installation processes. For first-time contributors, we recommend using the Vagrant development environment on macOS and Linux based OS and WSL 2 setup on Windows. These guides will walk every developer throught the steps to setup the environment to contribute to the project. The instructions are clear an easy to flow.

Assessment: **Reasonable** —The guide makes it easy to setup the development environment with links to download the necessary tools

### Organization

Assessment: **Organized** — Highly organised project with their Git easy to navigate and find what you are looking for. Their different repositories are clearly marked and with explanations as to what that repository focuses on. There are dedicated pages depending on wether you are the user or a contributor to aid you in either using their services or contributing to their project.

### Summary                  

It feel reletively easy to get started as a contributor to this project since all the initial help you might need is already lined uo for you with clear step on how to complete each step. They ahve a well documented project which makes it easy to understand the goal and mission of the project an what they are trying to achieve long-term.

## Assessment

Zulip is an exceptionally well-aligned project for me as a contributor. They are an organized chat for distributed teams, which is basically the same thing that we are trying to achieve on this course collerboaration. The technology stack is a strong match: it's primarily Python/Javascript, and I'm comfortable with some of the tooling.

**What makes this project approachable:**
Well structured documentation which makes it easy to understand the project and the goal. It has clearly marked first issues to build confidence as you start contributing to the project. The active community also encourages questions through the multiple forums that are there.

**What might make contributions harder:**
The Slack workspace is the real hub of communication, and it's not publicly accessible — a newcomer has to get an invitation. Im not too farmiliar with Tornado and Django, though im willing to learn. Im curious as to my reception from the community as I am not too familiar with some of these technologies and will be heavily reliant on the community for assistance.

**Overall:** I'm genuinely interested in this project. The combination of meaningful mission, familiar technologies, active maintainers, and clear newcomer pathways makes it the most interesting project i have reviewed. My biggest worry is the is learning these technologies in time for me to actively contribute torwads the project.
